	  Abstract

	</p>
	<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px"> 
		This paper examines the impact of agency-issue-induced incentive misalignment on the relation between risk (e.g., beta, idiosyncratic volatility or distress risk) and abnormal return in the stock market. 
		Using hand-collected data on portfolio manager ownership of U.S. active mutual funds, I construct a stock-level measure of exposure to incentives-induced trading and show that this measure is associated with the abnormally low returns of high-risk stocks. 
		Across a comprehensive set of strategies that buy high-risk stocks and sell low-risk stocks, negative alphas concentrate only among stocks subject to high incentives-induced trading. 
		This pattern is neither driven by other firm characteristics nor explained by fund performance, and the effect does not extend to other groups of anomaly strategies. 
		The findings are consistent with the conjecture that incentives-induced trading entails excessive risk taking that distorts market efficiency.

	</button>
	</p>
	<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px"> This paper studies hedging behavior of active mutual funds against flow volatility and its implications for fund performance. Recent evidence suggests that shocks to the common component of fund flows are a priced risk factor in expected stock returns. I find that nearly half of U.S. active equity funds tilt their portfolios toward stocks with higher exposure to common flows, suggesting that many funds do not hedge against flow risk. A model in which informed managers receive more precise private signals about common flows provides an explanation for this behavior. Using managers' portfolio tilt as a proxy for ability, I confirm the model's main prediction that funds having higher exposure to common flows generate better risk-adjusted performance. These funds also attract higher future flows.

	  Abstract
	</button>
	</p>
	<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px"> In a factor timing context, recent studies have emphasized on developing techniques that reduce the factor dimension and demonstrated return predictability using only a few predictors with specific choice of estimation design. This focus inadvertently neglects the crucial issue of model instability that has been shown to plague the forecasting literature. Using almost a hundred equity factors and a broader set of predictor variables, I find that the forecasting performance of recent factor timing techniques is indeed sensitive to the choice of empirical design. Applying a variety of shrinkage methods on predictors and focusing on forecasting individual factors to better capture the dynamics between factor returns and predictive signals, I document robust evidence of out-of-sample predictability and more stable investment performance for factor timing strategies. The optimal timing portfolio has a 30% higher Sharpe ratio and generates more than twice the economic gains relative to the factor dimension-reduction approach.

	<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px"> We examine the impact of non-severe depression on crowdsourced financial judgments using earnings forecasts from Estimize. Our findings reveal that an increase in the proportion of the U.S. population with depression is associated with improved forecast accuracy among users. This effect remains consistent across different measures and is distinct from the influence of temporary seasonal depression or other sentiment measures on decision-making. We identify two mechanisms, namely slow information processing and reduced optimism, that contribute to explaining our results. Overall, our research establishes a link between depression and crowdsourced financial evaluations.

	</button>
	</p>
	<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px"> The paper aims to examine relationships between search-based sentiment and stock market reactions in Vietnam. This study constructs an internet search-based measure of sentiment and examines its relationship with Vietnamese stock market returns. The sentiment index is derived from Google Trendsâ€™ Search Volume Index of financial and economic terms that Vietnamese searched from January 2011 to June 2018. Consistent with prediction from sentiment theories, the study documents significant short-term reversals across three major stock indices. The difference from previous literature is that Vietnam stock market absorbs the contemporaneous decline slower while the subsequent rebound happens within a day. The results of the study suggest that the sentiment-induced effect is mainly driven by pessimism. On the other hand, optimistic investors seem to delay in taking their investment action until the market corrects. The study proposes a unified explanation for our findings based on the overreaction hypothesis of the bearish group and the strategic delay of the optimistic group. The findings of the study contribute to the behavioral finance strand that studies the role of sentiment in emerging financial markets, where noise traders and limits to arbitrage are more obvious. They also encourage the continuous application of search data to explore other investor behaviors in securities markets.
