    I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Finance in the Trulaske College of Business at the University of Missouri. I will be on the 2024-2025 job market.
   </p>
   <p> My research interests are investments, asset pricing and behavioral finance. My <a href="https://du-dnguyen.github.io/papers/JMP2024_Nguyen.pdf">job market paper</a> examines the impact of agency-issue-induced incentive misalignment in the mutual fund industry on the risk-return relation in the stock market.
