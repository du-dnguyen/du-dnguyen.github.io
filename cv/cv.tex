%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section

  \begin{itemize}
  \item[] \emph{Abstract}: This paper tests whether financial judgments are improved by mild depression, using earnings forecasts from Estimize. We find that a 1-standard-deviation increase in the segment of the U.S. population with depression leads to a 0.25\% increase in future forecast accuracy. This effect is robust to alternative measures and is beyond the influence of seasonal depression or other sentiment measures on decision-making and, economically, compares to other determinants of Estimize users' accuracy. Reduced optimism and slow processing of information are two mechanisms that explain our findings. Overall, we contribute to the literature by linking a mental disorder to financial evaluations.

  \begin{itemize}
   \item[] \emph{Abstract}: We construct an internet search-based measure of sentiment and examine its relationship with Vietnam stock market returns. Consistent with prediction from sentiment theories, we document significant short-term reversals across three major stock indices. The difference from previous literature is that Vietnam stock market absorbs the contemporaneous decline slower while the rebound happens within a day. Further analysis implies that the sentiment-induced effect is mainly driven by pessimism. On the other hand, optimistic investors seem to delay in taking their investment action until the market corrects. Our empirical results contribute to the behavioral finance strand that studies the role of sentiment in emerging financial markets, where noise traders and limits to arbitrage are more obvious.
